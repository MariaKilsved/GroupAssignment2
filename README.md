# GroupAssignment2
## Objective
You are going to code a simple deck of playing cards, practicing Properties, Constructors and
switch expressions.

You donâ€™t need to change code in Main() the but you need to write the code requested in
DeckOfCards.cs and PlayingCards.cs. Running the program, it should:

- Randomly generate 3 cards using the using the default constructor (the one without
parameters). Print them out
- Initiate a fresh deck of cards with 52 Cards. Print out the deck
- Shuffle the deck. Print out the shuffled deck

#### Mandatory:
- Work in your assigned group
- Clone the repository https://github.com/smarlen/GroupAssignments.git
- Complete the code in the methods PlayingCard.FaceOrValue, PlayingCard.PlayingCard(), DeckOfCards.Shuffle(), DeckOfCards.FreshDeck(), DeckOfCards.DeckOfCards ()

#### Challenge (if you like to try):
- Modify the code in DeckOfCards and in DeckOfCards.GetTopCard() to return the top
card of the deck and reduce the number of cards in the deck with one.
- Test it with the code in Main() (which are commented out) to reduce three cards
from the deck, print them out to verify they are from the top of deck.
- Print out the new deck which should now contain 49 cards

#### Report:
- Hand in your group work with the names and participants in the group mentioned as
comments in the code at the deadline given. Hand in either as zip file or as a git link
repository.
- Each member in the group, send me a short separate email on your experience of the
groupwork
